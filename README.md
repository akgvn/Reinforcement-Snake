# Q Learning Project

The goal of this project is to develop an AI Agent that plays Snake.

To achieve that goal, I implemented a Q-Learning algorithm you can examine in QLA.py

Actual snake game code and assets are taken from Github: [maurock/
snake-ga](https://github.com/maurock/snake-ga) and adapted to work with my implementation instead of the maurock's existent Deep Learning one.
